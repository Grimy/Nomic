		All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the
		form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are
		in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules
		101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=102 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#102'>I.R. 102</a></legend>
		Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are
		mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed
		from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable
		regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be
		transmuted regardless of their numbers.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=103 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#103'>I.R. 103</a></legend>
		A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or
		amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of
		an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an
		immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

		<p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
		rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may
		not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable,
		may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted;
		no rule is absolutely immune to change.)

		Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The
		numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the
		proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not
		the proposal is adopted.
		<p>If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it
		receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended
		or transmuted, it receives the number of the proposal to amend or
		transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule
		of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or
		repeal the amendment.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=109 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#109'>I.R. 109</a></legend>
		Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=110 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#110'>I.R. 110</a></legend>
		In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable
		rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For
		the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule
		does not "conflict" with that immutable rule.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=111 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#111'>I.R. 111</a></legend>
		If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive
		of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded
		or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of
		questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue
		against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for
		this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is
		to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides
		the time to end debate and vote.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=112 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#112'>I.R. 112</a></legend>
		The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from
		achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n
		and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that
		establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while
		they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=114 class=rule>

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=115 class=rule>

		Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes
		are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend
		or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type
		of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or
		self-application of a rule.

		Players take turns in order according to a random ordered list
		generated by wilarseny using the Google Sheets "randomize range"
		function, and stored in the rules spreadsheet on the "score" tab. Turns
		may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted,
		except by failure to submit a proposal. All players begin with zero
		points.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=202 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#202'>M.R. 202</a></legend>
		One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one
		rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and
		adding the number of points on its face to one's score.
		<p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players
		subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the
		result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the
		nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first
		player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points
		are awarded for more popular proposals.)

		If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or

		the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
		<p>If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
		that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence
		over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall
		supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.
		<p>If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to
		defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=212 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#212'>M.R. 212</a></legend>
		If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation
		or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving
		is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the
		purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any
		player. This process is called invoking Judgment.
		<p>When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or
		her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.
		<p>The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of
		the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's
		Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the
		playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except
		that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the
		turn of a team-mate.
		<p>Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising
		from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to
		his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.
		<p>New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges
		may, however, settle only those questions on which the players
		currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which
		Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance
		with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent,
		inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge
		shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before
		applying other standards.

		If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the

		Votes must be cast by saying "yes" or "no" in the #voting channel. Votes take
		immediate effect once made. Editing or deleting your vote results in forfeited
		vote; you count for the purposes of "whether everyone has voted," but your vote
