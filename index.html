		<legend><a href='#101'>I.R. 101</a></legend>
		All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the
		form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are
		in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules
		101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).
	</fieldset>
	<ul class=history>
		<li>Part of the Initial Set
</div>

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=102 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#102'>I.R. 102</a></legend>
		Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are
		mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed
		from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable
		regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be
		transmuted regardless of their numbers.

</div>

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=103 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#103'>I.R. 103</a></legend>
		A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or
		amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of
		an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an
		immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

		<p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
		rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may
		not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable,
		may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted;
		no rule is absolutely immune to change.)

<div class=flexbox>
	<fieldset id=104 class=rule>
		<legend><a href='#104'>I.R. 104</a></legend>
		All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They
		will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of
		votes.

<div class=flexbox>
