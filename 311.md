## Re: Bill #311

There is some ongoing controversy over bill #311, suggested by Pillar Monkey. This bill contains three proposals:

1. Transmute #109 into a mutable rule
2. Amend #109
3. Transmute #109 into an immutable rule

The present page is intended to give my opinion on the topic. It is neither a rule nor a Judgment.

### What is a rule-change?

I.R. 103 says:

    A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

This is a **definition** of “rule-change”. It doesn’t merely say that those seven things are rule-changes, which would leave open the question of whether
other things can be rule-changes. It says that a rule-change **is** one of those seven things, meaning that other things are not rule-changes.

No other rules attempt to define “rule-change”, so there is no conflict.

### When should the adoption requirements be evaluated?

M.R. 310 says:

    A bill must pass the adoption requirements of all of its proposals in order to pass.

But this is ambiguous. If—such as is the case with bill #311—an earlier proposal changes the adoption requirements
for a later proposal, we are left with a conundrum: should the bill be required to pass the adoption requirements
of the latter proposal such as they were at the time of the vote, or such that they will be once the earlier proposal passes?

I will defend that this doesn’t matter here, and leave that decision for another turn.

### Is proposal 2 of bill #311 a rule-change?

Proposal 2 proposes to amend rule 109. Since we haven’t decided on the previous question, there are two cases to consider:

* Before proposal 1 passes, rule 109 is immutable; thus amending rule 109 is an amendment of an immutable rule.
* After proposal 1 passes, rule 109 is renumbered to 311 (by virtue of I.R. 108); thus amending rule 109 is an amendment of a non-rule.

Neither “amendment of an immutable rule” nor “amendment of a non-rule” are listed in I.R. 103’s definition of a rule-change, which only contains
“amendment of a mutable rule” and “amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule”. Thus, in both cases **proposal 2 is not a rule-change**.

### Can a bill contain non-rule-changes?

As per M.R. 310, a bill can only consist of proposals. But what is a proposal?
The term is not clearly defined anywhere. The closest we have is I.R. 108,
which begins:

    Each proposed rule-change

This seems to strongly imply that proposals are rule-changes. However, I will not argue that way.

### What are the adoption requirements for non-rule-changes?

The only rules that define adoption requirements are I.R. 104, I.R. 109, and M.R. 301.

I.R. 104 says (emphasis mine):

    All **rule-changes** proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

I.R. 109 says (emphasis mine):

    **Rule-changes** that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters.

M.R. 301 says (emphasis mine):

    A **rule-change** is adopted if and only if the vote is accepted by a 2/3 majority of eligible voters. 

All those rules are only applicable to rule-changes. No rules define adoption
requirements for non-rule-changes.

Let’s turn to I.R. 116:

    changing the rules (…) is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it

Defining adoption requirements for non-rule-changes would permit changing the
rules. Thus, per I.R. 116, only “a rule or set of rules” may do so. Since no
rule currently does, **non-rule-changes don’t have adoption requirements**.

### Conclusion

* The second proposal of bill #311 is not a rule-change; thus
* The second proposal of bill #311 does not have adoption requirements; thus
* Bill #311 does not pass the adoption requirements of its second proposal; thus
* Bill #311 does not pass the adoption requirements of all its proposals; thus
* Bill #311 shall not pass; thus
* None of the proposals in bill #311 shall pass.
